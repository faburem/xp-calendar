While the current datetime plugin fulfills it's purpose of being a lightweight and simple calendar it misses some advanced features you would expect from a desktop calendar nowadays.

The following enhancements are currently planned:

  * ~~Make the start of the week configurable (Monday vs. Sunday)~~
    * seems like this is deprecated since 2004 you can achieve this by updating your ~/.profile as mentioned in this [post](http://forum.xfce.org/viewtopic.php?id=7402)
  * Add Google calendar integration
  * Add a world clock (display time of multiple time zones)
  * make it awesome!

Currently implemented features:
  * Open Google Calendar in your webbrowser when clicking on a date in the calendar (Google calendar will center on that date)
